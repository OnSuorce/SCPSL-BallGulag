# SCPSL-BallGulag

Inspired by the gulag of Call of Duty Modern Warfare: when a player dies he has the opportunity to respawn (with even a reward) but only if he survives. 
In the gulag there are only 2 player, each one has the SCP-018 in the inventory and they must throw it, wins who survives (or the last one to die). There are no second chances.
On respawn the player will be a scientist and will receive his health back and also some basic item. If the light containment zone has been decontaminated the player will spawn 
as scientist in the SCP-049 room with some mid-tier items.
